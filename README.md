# Interactive 3D Product Viewer

A Three.js-based interactive 3D product viewer that demonstrates basic mesh composition, lighting, and user interaction.

## Features

- Interactive 3D chair model built from basic Three.js geometries
- Orbit controls for manual camera manipulation
- Automatic camera rotation around the product
- Interactive parts highlighting and information display
- Responsive design that adapts to window resizing
- Professional lighting setup with ambient and directional lights

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Usage

- **View the Product**: The chair will automatically rotate for a complete view

- **Interaction**: Click on parts to see a scale animation effect
